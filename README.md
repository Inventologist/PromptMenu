# PromptMenu
This gives you a Menu EVERY time you run powershell

## Welcome to PromptMenu!
This was an exercise born from a desire to have commands run (where they exist as functions) and prepopulate a command line for them and EXECUTE it.  I ended up having to do the execution of the prepopulated command line in a fairly strange way, with a background job.

I tried to keep this fairly modular, with a CSV file controlling the Menu Items, Colors, and command lines to run (if PrepProcess = 1)

I'll insert some ways to use this in the near future.
